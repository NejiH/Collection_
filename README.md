## My Process

### Built with

- Xcode
- Supabase
- DrawSQL

### What I learned

Since it's my very first Swift and SwiftUI project, I've learned everything. But I noticed a few things like : 

- We should handle carefully the NavigationStack and NavigationLink in order not to break the app
- It's better to start to work with a mock db before to setup and connect the real one
- Informations can be transfered through a notification... even if I don't use it in this project ^^ 
- And so much more... 


### Next steps

- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find items within the collections.
- **Delete**: easily delete any item or collection
- **Collection type**: Add more type such as boardgames, video games, books, etc.
- **Users**: Add an authentification system
- **Design**: Improve the design
