## Overview

### The Challenge

- **Menu Navigation**: Easily navigate through the app to access different collections.
- **Collection Management**: Add, edit, and delete items in the collections.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find items within the collections.
- **Database**: Connect the app to a database via Supabase.

## My Process

### Built with

- Xcode
- Supabase
- DrawSQL

### What I learned

Since it's my very first Swift and SwiftUI project, I've learned everything. But I noticed a few things like : 

- We should handle carefully the NavigationStack and NavigationLink in order not to break the app
- It's better to start to work with a mock db before to setup and connect the real one
- Informations can be transfered through a notification
- And so much more... 


### Next steps

- Add more collection type
- Connect to Supabase to use my databse
- Improve the design
